### Bone marrow analysis


This repository contains code and data needed to reproduce the analysis from this paper: **Cell-cell interactome of the hematopoietic niche and its changes in acute myeloid leukemia.** *Ennis S et. al., iScience, 2023*. DOI: [10.1016/j.isci.2023.106943](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2023.106943).

The raw scRNA-seq data that was generated as part of this study is available on GEO ([GSE227903](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE227903)) and the integrated scRNA-seq atlas of the bone marrow in health and AML is available on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5931689).

To explore the integrated dataset, this repository contains a Google Colab notebook ([bone_marrow_atlas.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Sarah145/bone_marrow_analysis/blob/master/bone_marrow_atlas.ipynb)) that contains code to generate an interactive cellxgene session.
